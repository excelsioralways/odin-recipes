    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lasagna is pretty much always guaranteed to impress. There are very few people who can resist all that cheesy,
        meaty goodness. And even though a classic lasagna is a thing of beauty, this chicken lasagna recipe would easily
        become your go-to from now on.
    </p>
    <p>This cheesy lasagna is made using shredded chicken in place of ground beef or sausage. Not only is it ever so
        slightly lighter because the chicken doesn't add much in terms of fat or rich, beefy flavour. Layering the
        lasagna with grated cheddar and mozzarella adds all the melty goodness you want when you're eating a plate of
        comforting lasagna.
