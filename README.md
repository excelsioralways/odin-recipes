# odin-recipes

The goal of this project is to create a recipe website. 
The index page will contain a link to various recipes.
Each recipe will have a page of its own that will dive deeper and provide cooking instructions. 
By the end of this project, I am hoping to gain knowledge about various elements available in HTML. 
I am also hoping to learn how to create the structure of any website.
